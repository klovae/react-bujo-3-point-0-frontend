      <h1>Using BuJo 3.0</h1>

        <p>
          BuJo 3.0 was designed to mimic the everyday functions of the standard Bullet Journal methodology. You can think of it as your collection of Daily Logs: just like if you were using a physical paper journal, you can add, edit, delete, and migrate your tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're unfamiliar with Bullet Journaling, be sure to check out the <a href="http://bulletjournal.com/get-started/">"Get Started" section</a> on Bulletjournal.com.
        </p>

        <h2>What BuJo 3.0 Can Do</h2>
        <p>
          When you log into BuJo 3.0 for the first time, you'll see the daily log for today. All you need to do to get started is to create your first task: click the line under Tasks, fill in the content, and press the "+" button to add it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Examples of Tasks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Send invoice to client</li>
          <li>Finish HTML and CSS for Rails application</li>
          <li>Create playlist for next week's party</li>
          <li>Push app to Heroku</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A task in BuJo 3.0 looks like this:
